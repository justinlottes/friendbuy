### INSTALL

npm install


### RUN

npm run start


### TESTING
I didn't have time to make the tests easier to run, but in the iconsole module, there is a TestConsole class.  You can add new command string arrrays in there and change the readline method to pull from the desired array to manually test different scenarios.
