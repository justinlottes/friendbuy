### INSTALL

npm install


### RUN

From the project root run:
	node ./dist/index.js


### ASSUMPTIONS

Valid input data
	Adding data validator would be a trivial task via JOI or similar module
I Cheated and imported the JSON documents directly.  To change which files are run, replace the files in the dist/data directory
